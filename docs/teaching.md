# Our teaching approach to the Micro:bit in summer camps

## The summer camp context

- Kids are there to have fun: they want to play
- Age groups are less uniform
- Many kids come because they like computers

## The "Take the code out!" philosophy

The microbit is a small battery powered microcontroller with sensors and on-board radio that can be carried around easily. We wanted to take advantage of its portability and interactivity to create games.

## The essential role of sound

## About hardware

### Power and buzzer back plates
Before camp, we purshaced MI-Power backplates at Amazon. This add-on attaches behind the microbit makes it possible to power it with a small 3V coin-cell battery and provides an ON/OFF switch and a speaker. It gave us a new world of possibilities and made working with the microbits much easier. Not having a battery pack dangling around while we play with the microbit was a big plus. We highly recommend to addapt all the Microbits with these plates when going to classes. Having the tiny speakers was also a big advantage for us because a lot our activities involved sound. There are other similar product available. The Power:bit from Elecfreaks for example is a very good product.

### Portable speakers and audio jack enclosers
To do these activities we had to build enclosers for the Microbits that included an ON/OFF switch and an INPUT audio jack. Also we used a small sound system to amplify the sound. Sound became so important in the activities that we really encourage to boost up this feature. It would be especially important to add sound features to Artbit in the near future to be able to introduce sound to the younger audience.

## Structure of the website

The KCJ Summercamp microwebsite is divided based on the structure of a week at camp. There is one page per day of camp. We tried our best to establish a structure for every lesson that was the same every day. We start off with an unplugged activity, then we do a coding session and then we go outside and play with the micrbits. The layout of each page reflects this structure. In each page, there are 6 different sections.

1. Introductory unplugged actvity: this section describes the unplugged activity we do at the begining of every class.
2. Makecode coding session - Older kids (age 8 to 12): this section shows the code that we build on Makecode with the older kids.
3. Artbit coding session - Young kids (age 5 to 8): this section shows the code that we build on Artbit with the younger kids.
4. Take the code out!: this section explains the game that we play we the microbits
5. Changes to the plan: this section highlights changes we have made to the plan on the first edition of the summer camp in 2018.
6. Conclusions: In this section we go through the different activities and point out the good things, the less good point and how we could improve.
