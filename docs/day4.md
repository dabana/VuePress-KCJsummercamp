# DAY 4: The treasure hunt

With the help of technology and a pirate map, the crew finds the treasure and the key to open it.

## 1. Introductory unplugged activity

### Draw a treasure map (inpired by RTP Unseen Structure)

> INDOOR or OUTDOOR

1) A map to the treasure is hidden in a closed room (the cave) guarded by an instructor. The map indicates the location of the key and the treasure chest in relationship with other elements present on the camp site susch as roads, buildings, play areas, forest, etc.
2) The group is divided into two teams. In each team, one person is designated to draw the map. This persone is the only person who has the right to draw.
3) Every team sends one scout (expect the person drawing the map) at a time to check the map in the cave. 
4) The scout has only 3 seconds to look at the map. The instructor guarding the cave controls the time.
5) The scout then goes back to his team. The scout explains with words (can't take the pencil) to the person drawing what he saw in the cave. 
6) Steps 3 to 5 are repeated several times. The drawer tries to reproduce the map correctly based on the information he receives from the scouts. 
7) Once every kid has gone to the cave at least 2 times and the map is complete, the two teams compare their maps.
8) We discuss the differences and similarities between the two maps and what could we improve and where are the key and the treasure based on the maps.

```diff
Feed back of tests with KCJ team (21-06-2018): 
+ Very good feedback. Include darkness and a candle light for 3 seconds to visualize maps.
+ Simplify the Map for the Kids
```

## 2. Makecode coding session - Older kids (age 8 to 12)

### The treasure range finder

```diff
+ TODAY WE LEARN:
1. What is a radio frequency/group/channel?
2. What is a variable in code?
3. How to sense distance with radio?
```
One microbit is the emitter. It broadcasts a message all the time. The other microbit is the reciever. This is the micrbit that is used to detect the treasure and that the kids have to code. This code is very similar to the one for the fish finder in day 2 except for the radio blocks.

### 2.1 Blocks Code

### 2.2 Text Code
> Emitter
```javascript
radio.setGroup(2)
basic.forever(() => {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Skull)
    radio.sendNumber(0)
})
```
>Reciever
```javascript
let Note2 = 0
let intervale = 0
radio.onDataPacketReceived( ({ signal, receivedNumber }) =>  {
    intervale = Math.abs(signal)
    Note2 = 20000 / intervale
})
radio.setGroup(2)
basic.forever(() => {
    music.playTone(Note2, intervale)
    music.rest(intervale)
})
```

## 3. Artbit coding session - Young kids (age 5 to 8)

```diff
+ TODAY WE LEARN:
1. What is a message?  
2. How can we send messages?
3. How can we receive message?
```

## 4. Take the code out!

### The treasure hunt

> OUTDOOR

The crew programs their microbit so they can be used as a range finders. With the help of their map and their special treasure detector, they can now hunt down the treasure (the emitter).

1) One team is sent to find the key and the other is sent to find the treasure chest.
2) The range finder produces a sound which frequency increases with decreasing distance from the target. 
3) Once the team is very close to the target they should be able to see it.

```diff
Feed back of tests with KCJ team (21-06-2018): 
+ Very good feedback. The Radio signal worked as expected within the programmed ranges.
+ Option of giving many Microbits with different sounds could be confusing.
+ Amplify the sound
```
## 5. Changes to the plan

### Young kids (age 5 to 8)

We did not do the unplugged activity with the younger kids. Instead, we showed them our pirate map and explained them the different symbols and the fact that it was a top view of the camp. During the drawing activity, the kids had to draw there own pirate map to the treasure inspired by our map. This was a nice activity to develop abstraction. As for the coding activity, we had them create different images depending on what message they receive. The emitter was coded by the isntructor. As for the previous days, we did the treasure hunt game in parallel with the coding session with the help of our helper instructor.   

### Older kids (age 8 to 12)

We decided to introduce the concept of radio with a totaly different activity than originaly planned. In this activity, the kids create a collective work using the radio to pass message from one microbit to the next. They have to make up a story or a song of their choice as a team. Everyone has to have the right code for collective artwork to work. It is a very interesting activity to develop team work and see leadership emerge.

## 6. Conclusions 

### Young kids (age 5 to 8)
1. **Unplugged Activities**

We introduced kids to what is a map and its symbols. The idea was that they start to understand what a map is, how it is an abstraction of the reality from the top view and how easy it is to identify objects on it. The results were fun and interesting.

2. **Coding**

We tryied to show the concept of radio. Some of the kids understood and achieved to goal of the activity (which was to show an image on message received). Some did not get it that much. We simply encouraged them to continue working on their animations.

3. **Taking the code out**

This game worked really well. This time we created two groups of about 7 kids. We gave them a microbit each and challenged them to find the treasure and the key. We first made a demo of how to detector works by making them listen to the changing sound of the receiver microbit as the instructor gets closer with the emitter. The instructor then hides the emitter. The little kids loved to go out with the beeping microbit in search of the treasure. With the detectors (and a little help from the isntructor) they succesfully find the treasure and the key within 10 to 15 minutes. Once the treasure is found, we proceeded to the distribution of the treasure (plastics gems and golden coins). This last step is very important with young kids.

### Older kids (age 8 to 12)
1. **Unplugged Activities**

The treasure map unplugged activity was a success. Both teams had fun memorizing the map and locating the treasure and the key. This is a game that we recommend alongside with the architect (day 2) and the secret object (day 3) as unplugged activities.

2. **Coding**

In this class, we tryied to teach radio communication through experimentation with a collaborative project. We teach them the basics of how to send a messag and perform an aciton on the reception of the message. After the demonstration, we designate some 'leaders' in the class to help create a series of images and sounds through sending messages in different channels. We enjoyed the game a lot. We would recommend careful attention to select the 'right' leaders. We also recommend creating a well defined project objective so they have to take less decisions and focus on the activity. Giving the kids responsability was a great idea. From that point, they were on their own and they had to cooperate all together to accomplish the objective. We observed very interesting dynamics. We found that with a little structure, it is possible to give the kids power and responsability in the problem solving process.

3. **Taking the code out**

The treasure hunt was a success with this age group too. We made the research a little more challenging for them.
